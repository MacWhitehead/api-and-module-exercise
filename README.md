# api-and-module-exercise

This was an exercise to learn code modules in Javascript, 
as well as accessing API data. Utilizing the Pokémon API
made the process a lot more fun. I loved Pokémon when I was
growing up and Bulbasaur and Farfetch'd were my favorite!
I always laughed watching Farfetch'd smack people around 
with a leek.
